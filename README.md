## Prerequisites

* Yarn Version 1.22.5 (or later) to handle setup, dependency management, and builds

## Setup

A ```package.json``` file is included with all required dependencies. To initially setup the project, in the ```frontend``` directory
```console
yarn install
```
This will install all dependencies in the local ```node_modules``` directory.

Note this is only needed for the first compile to generate the ```yarn.lock``` file.\
